# Collatz conjecture
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that proposes that given any nonnegative odd interger greater than or equal 1, the elements ```[4, 2, 1]``` will be infinitely repeated by the sequence created by replicating the following algorithm:
 1. Start with any nonnegative odd interger greater than or equal 1 as the first term.
 2. If the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term.
 3. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
 4. Repeat Steps 1-3 with the created term
